# IPO Application Automator

## Overview

This project automates the process of applying to IPOs on the MeroShare platform. Given a list of applicants, it logs in on their behalf, navigates to the IPO application page, lists open IPOs, and allows applying for selected IPOs automatically.

The project is built using **Python** and **Selenium WebDriver**, enabling automated browser interactions.
